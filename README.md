# Usage
- When you run Snort in intrusion detection mode, it logs alerts in the alert_json.txt file. 
- The server constantly monitors the file and whenever it detects a change, it reads the whole file. 
- The server then passes the data to the client, which in turn instantly displays the alerts in an organized way. 
- The app uses the socket.io library for real-time communication between the server and the client.
- By clicking on one of the alerts in the live log, you can see all the details about the alert. 
- Below the live log, you can see the most common source IP addresses, dates and types of attacks, along with most common alert priorities.
